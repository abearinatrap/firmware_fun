Reverse-engineering px4 firmware

px4_output is the firmware code to use in ghidra

When opening up in ghidra, if you are starting a new project, 
I believe it is ARM, Cortex, 32, Little Endian.... not sure though, will have to look more into it.

px4_to_image.ipynb is the jupyter notebook file I used to create the firmware code from the image file

The ghidra project file is in ghidra_files, if you want to just see what I have looked at so far.
